/*
	The "Dutch National Flag" algorithm efficiently sorts an array
	containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s in linear time (O(n)) and constant space (O(1)).

	It achieves this by using three pointers: low, mid, and high.
	The algorithm partitions the array into three sections: elements less than 1 (0s),
	elements equal to 1, and elements greater than 1 (2s).
